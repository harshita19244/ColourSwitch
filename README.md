2. The implementation of the project follows a strict object-oriented paradigm in addition to generic programming with well-defined classes for each component of the gameplay.
3. The gameplay additionally uses the functionality of event-driven programming using JavaFX to create an infinite gameplay setting, various obstacles and transitions for all moving objects. 
4. It also utilizes threads and timers for parallel execution of multiple features such as moving the ball, incrementing the high and checking collisions with other game components. 
5. It takes into account various design patterns of software development.
Additionally, serialization has been implemented to store the progress during a particular setting of the game.  

## Design Patterns:
1. Singleton
2. Iterator
3. Facade

## Code and assets:
